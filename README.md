# Web Notes

## Description

Web Notes is an online website where you can take notes and keep track of them. I built this project to practice using Express.js, to create routes to different HTML pages and routes for the website’s API. It was interesting to see how a website processes different requests and URLs, depending on their structure and method. Basically, this is how the front end of a website communicates with its back end and vice versa. With this knowledge I now understand the purpose of URLs and web APIs, since they help pass information between the different parts and components of a website.
